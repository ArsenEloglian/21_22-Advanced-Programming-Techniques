Since the first development of lithium-ion batteries in the early 1990 s, there have been tremendous advances in the science and
technology of these electrochemical energy sources. At present, lithium batteries dominate the field of advanced power sources
and have almost entirely replaced their bulkier and less energetic counterparts such as nickel-cadmium and nickel-metalhydride
batteries; especially in portable electronic devices. But lithium batteries are still the object of continuing intense research aimed
at making further improvements in performance and safety, at lower cost, so as to make them suitable for higher-power and
more demanding applications such as electric vehicles. The research and development of new electrode materials, particularly
for cathodes, having an improved electrochemical performance has always been a matter of changing focus. Thus, olivine,
lithium iron phosphate, has attracted considerable attention in recent years as a safe, environmentally friendly, extremely stable
and very promising cathode material.It is well-known that fossil fuels are being rapidly depleted, and that atomic power is rejected by many people. As a consequence,
there is a strong trend towards alternative sources such as wind, photovoltaics, solar heat and biomass. Strangely enough, quite
another power source is generally neglected: namely, the thermoelectric generator (a device which converts heat, i.e. thermal
energy, directly into electrical energy). The reason for this neglect is probably the low conversion efficiency, which is of the
order of a few percent at most. However, there are two arguments in favor of the thermoelectric generator. Firstly, we might in
effect be at the same point as we were in the early stages of photovoltaics use (it was only in 1954 that the first attractive solar
cells, with efficiencies of around 4% were produced). Today, even large modules attain 20%. Secondly, the potential applications
of thermoelectric generators are very tempting. Wherever heat is generated, it is amenable to electrical conversion. Energy
harvesting via a thermoelectric generator may be accompanied by a further benefit: The use of a solar module inevitably leads to
a drastic temperature rise. A thermoelectric generator reduces the temperature rise and therefore offers a double benefit.
The electronic properties of solids have become of increasing importance in the age of information technology. The study of
solids and materials, while having originated from the disciplines of physics and chemistry, has evolved independently over the
past few decades. The classical treatment of solid-state physics, which emphasized classifications, theories and fundamental
physical principles, is no longer able to bridge the gap between materials advances and applications. In particular, the more
recent developments in device physics and technology have not necessarily been driven by new concepts in physics or new
materials, but rather by the ability of engineers to control crystal structures and properties better via advances in crystal growth
and patterning techniques. In many cases, new applications simply arise from the adaption of conventional ideas to
interdisciplinary areas. One example is that of recent advances which rely heavily upon the availability of the sub-micron
technology developed by the semiconductor industry. Another example is the emergence of nanotechnology.
This monograph deals with a physico-chemical approach to the problem of the solid-state growth of chemical compound layers
and reaction-diffusion in binary heterogeneous systems formed by two solids; as well as a solid with a liquid or a gas. It is
explained why the number of compound layers growing at the interface between the original phases is usually much lower than
the number of chemical compounds in the phase diagram of a given binary system. For example, of the eight intermetallic
compounds which exist in the aluminium-zirconium binary system, only ZrAl3 was found to grow as a separate layer at the
Al Zr interface under isothermal conditions. The physico-chemical approach predicts that, in most cases, the number of
compound layers should not exceed two; with the main factor, resulting in the appearance of additional layers, being crack
formation due to thermal expansion and volume effects.
The aim of this book is to develop, in the reader, the necessary skills required for designing materials, components and
structures so as to resist fracture and failure in engineering applications. In order to achieve this objective, the authors have
adopted a combined materials science-fracture mechanics-design approach. Although the material covered is designed for an
advanced undergraduate course in metallurgy/materials engineering, students coming from mechanical, civil or aerospace
engineering backgrounds will also be able to use this text as a course/reference book. In addition to students, practising
engineers and production mangers will also find this book very useful; particular with regard to designing components and
machine elements so as to resist fracture and failure in critical applications.
The present volume comprises a collection of peer-reviewed papers covering manufacture and production, engineering
materials, CAD/CAM/CAE, robotics, automation and control, environment-friendly design and manufacture, web/internet
technologies, artificial intelligence and smart computing in design and manufacture, enterprise, management, and other related
topics.Composite materials are increasingly finding use in diverse applications requiring a wide range of property and performance
requirements. Low density, high specific strength and stiffness are the main features that make composite materials most
suitable for structural applications. The field covers the concurrent manipulation of the material’s composition and of the
internal architecture of the composite in order to obtain the desired properties. The ability to tailor composite materials
precisely is of great importance in structural applications. A systematic approach to the optimum tailoring of composite
materials is a challenging design problem. The focus should be on the practical design aspects, and that is what is addressed in
this special-topic volume.The electronic properties of solids have become of increasing importance in the age of information technology. The study of

technologies, artificial intelligence and smart computing in design and manufacture, enterprise, management, and other related
topics.This work comprises eight contributions from leading experts on the topic of the mechanical behaviour of materials. The
research themes described in this special volume range from surface forces, surface energies and adhesion to the indentation
and nano-indentation of solids and fracture waves in glasses to spectroscopic studies of biological cells.The field of “polymers in concrete” is rather well consolidated within the construction industry, and its future will be one of
benefiting fully from the synergy between the organic and mineral materials. Concrete-polymer composites (C-PC) exhibit
excellent adhesion strength and durability in aggressive environments and the good performance of these materials makes
innovative applications possible; including new technologies for restoring and renovating buildings.
The purpose of this book is to present the current state of knowledge in the field of energy harvesting using piezoelectric and
pyroelectric materials. The book is addressed to students and academics engaged in research in the fields of energy harvesting,
material sciences and engineering. Scientists and engineers who are working in the area of energy conservation and renewable
energy resources should find it useful as well. Explanations of fundamental physical properties such as piezoelectricity and
pyroelectricity are included to aid the understanding of the non-specialist. Specific technologies and particular applications are
also presented. This book is divided into two parts, each subdivided into chapters. Part I concerns fundamentals. Chapter 1
reports the discoveries, standard issues and various materials involved with energy harvesting. Chapter 2 presents
electromechanical models enabling an understanding of how energy harvesting systems behave. The vibration theory and
designs for various piezoelectric energy harvesting structures are addressed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes the analytical
expressions for the energy flow in piezoelectric energy harvesting systems, in particular, with cymbal and flexible transducers. A
description of the conversion enhancement for powering low-energy consumption devices is presented in Chapter 5. Part II
concerns Applications and Case Studies. It begins with Chapter 6, in which the principles and applications of piezoelectric
nanogenerators are reported. Chapter 7 describes the utilization of energy harvesting from low-frequency energy sources. There
are more ways to use vibrational energy than waste heat. However, Chapter 8 presents the fundamentals of an important
application of heat conversion with a copolymer. Finally, commercial energy harvesting products and a technological forecast
are provided in Chapter 9.A major goal of this special collection of 47 peer-reviewed papers was to gather together the current knowledge of academic
scientists, engineers and industrial researchers and have them share their experiences and research results concerning every
aspect of green building technologies and materials, and discuss the practical challenges encountered and the solutions adopted.
An interesting guide to this increasingly relevant subject.The goal of this special collection of peer-reviewed papers was to provide an unique opportunity to exchange information, to

Since the first development of lithium-ion batteries in the early 1990 s, there have been tremendous advances in the science and
technology of these electrochemical energy sources. At present, lithium batteries dominate the field of advanced power sources
and have almost entirely replaced their bulkier and less energetic counterparts such as nickel-cadmium and nickel-metalhydride
batteries; especially in portable electronic devices. But lithium batteries are still the object of continuing intense research aimed
at making further improvements in performance and safety, at lower cost, so as to make them suitable for higher-power and
more demanding applications such as electric vehicles. The research and development of new electrode materials, particularly
for cathodes, having an improved electrochemical performance has always been a matter of changing focus. Thus, olivine,
lithium iron phosphate, has attracted considerable attention in recent years as a safe, environmentally friendly, extremely stable
and very promising cathode material.It is well-known that fossil fuels are being rapidly depleted, and that atomic power is rejected by many people. As a consequence,
there is a strong trend towards alternative sources such as wind, photovoltaics, solar heat and biomass. Strangely enough, quite
another power source is generally neglected: namely, the thermoelectric generator (a device which converts heat, i.e. thermal
energy, directly into electrical energy). The reason for this neglect is probably the low conversion efficiency, which is of the
order of a few percent at most. However, there are two arguments in favor of the thermoelectric generator. Firstly, we might in
effect be at the same point as we were in the early stages of photovoltaics use (it was only in 1954 that the first attractive solar
cells, with efficiencies of around 4% were produced). Today, even large modules attain 20%. Secondly, the potential applications
of thermoelectric generators are very tempting. Wherever heat is generated, it is amenable to electrical conversion. Energy
harvesting via a thermoelectric generator may be accompanied by a further benefit: The use of a solar module inevitably leads to
a drastic temperature rise. A thermoelectric generator reduces the temperature rise and therefore offers a double benefit.
The electronic properties of solids have become of increasing importance in the age of information technology. The study of
solids and materials, while having originated from the disciplines of physics and chemistry, has evolved independently over the
past few decades. The classical treatment of solid-state physics, which emphasized classifications, theories and fundamental
physical principles, is no longer able to bridge the gap between materials advances and applications. In particular, the more
recent developments in device physics and technology have not necessarily been driven by new concepts in physics or new
materials, but rather by the ability of engineers to control crystal structures and properties better via advances in crystal growth
and patterning techniques. In many cases, new applications simply arise from the adaption of conventional ideas to
interdisciplinary areas. One example is that of recent advances which rely heavily upon the availability of the sub-micron
technology developed by the semiconductor industry. Another example is the emergence of nanotechnology.
This monograph deals with a physico-chemical approach to the problem of the solid-state growth of chemical compound layers
and reaction-diffusion in binary heterogeneous systems formed by two solids; as well as a solid with a liquid or a gas. It is
explained why the number of compound layers growing at the interface between the original phases is usually much lower than
the number of chemical compounds in the phase diagram of a given binary system. For example, of the eight intermetallic
compounds which exist in the aluminium-zirconium binary system, only ZrAl3 was found to grow as a separate layer at the
Al Zr interface under isothermal conditions. The physico-chemical approach predicts that, in most cases, the number of
compound layers should not exceed two; with the main factor, resulting in the appearance of additional layers, being crack
formation due to thermal expansion and volume effects.

technologies, artificial intelligence and smart computing in design and manufacture, enterprise, management, and other related
topics.Composite materials are increasingly finding use in diverse applications requiring a wide range of property and performance
requirements. Low density, high specific strength and stiffness are the main features that make composite materials most
suitable for structural applications. The field covers the concurrent manipulation of the material’s composition and of the
internal architecture of the composite in order to obtain the desired properties. The ability to tailor composite materials
precisely is of great importance in structural applications. A systematic approach to the optimum tailoring of composite
materials is a challenging design problem. The focus should be on the practical design aspects, and that is what is addressed in
this special-topic volume.The electronic properties of solids have become of increasing importance in the age of information technology. The study of

Since the first development of lithium-ion batteries in the early 1990 s, there have been tremendous advances in the science and
technology of these electrochemical energy sources. At present, lithium batteries dominate the field of advanced power sources
and have almost entirely replaced their bulkier and less energetic counterparts such as nickel-cadmium and nickel-metalhydride
batteries; especially in portable electronic devices. But lithium batteries are still the object of continuing intense research aimed
at making further improvements in performance and safety, at lower cost, so as to make them suitable for higher-power and
more demanding applications such as electric vehicles. The research and development of new electrode materials, particularly
for cathodes, having an improved electrochemical performance has always been a matter of changing focus. Thus, olivine,
lithium iron phosphate, has attracted considerable attention in recent years as a safe, environmentally friendly, extremely stable
and very promising cathode material.It is well-known that fossil fuels are being rapidly depleted, and that atomic power is rejected by many people. As a consequence,
there is a strong trend towards alternative sources such as wind, photovoltaics, solar heat and biomass. Strangely enough, quite
another power source is generally neglected: namely, the thermoelectric generator (a device which converts heat, i.e. thermal
energy, directly into electrical energy). The reason for this neglect is probably the low conversion efficiency, which is of the
order of a few percent at most. However, there are two arguments in favor of the thermoelectric generator. Firstly, we might in
effect be at the same point as we were in the early stages of photovoltaics use (it was only in 1954 that the first attractive solar
cells, with efficiencies of around 4% were produced). Today, even large modules attain 20%. Secondly, the potential applications
of thermoelectric generators are very tempting. Wherever heat is generated, it is amenable to electrical conversion. Energy
harvesting via a thermoelectric generator may be accompanied by a further benefit: The use of a solar module inevitably leads to
a drastic temperature rise. A thermoelectric generator reduces the temperature rise and therefore offers a double benefit.
The electronic properties of solids have become of increasing importance in the age of information technology. The study of
solids and materials, while having originated from the disciplines of physics and chemistry, has evolved independently over the
past few decades. The classical treatment of solid-state physics, which emphasized classifications, theories and fundamental
physical principles, is no longer able to bridge the gap between materials advances and applications. In particular, the more
recent developments in device physics and technology have not necessarily been driven by new concepts in physics or new
materials, but rather by the ability of engineers to control crystal structures and properties better via advances in crystal growth
and patterning techniques. In many cases, new applications simply arise from the adaption of conventional ideas to
interdisciplinary areas. One example is that of recent advances which rely heavily upon the availability of the sub-micron
technology developed by the semiconductor industry. Another example is the emergence of nanotechnology.
This monograph deals with a physico-chemical approach to the problem of the solid-state growth of chemical compound layers
and reaction-diffusion in binary heterogeneous systems formed by two solids; as well as a solid with a liquid or a gas. It is
explained why the number of compound layers growing at the interface between the original phases is usually much lower than
the number of chemical compounds in the phase diagram of a given binary system. For example, of the eight intermetallic
compounds which exist in the aluminium-zirconium binary system, only ZrAl3 was found to grow as a separate layer at the
Al Zr interface under isothermal conditions. The physico-chemical approach predicts that, in most cases, the number of
compound layers should not exceed two; with the main factor, resulting in the appearance of additional layers, being crack
formation due to thermal expansion and volume effects.
The aim of this book is to develop, in the reader, the necessary skills required for designing materials, components and
structures so as to resist fracture and failure in engineering applications. In order to achieve this objective, the authors have
adopted a combined materials science-fracture mechanics-design approach. Although the material covered is designed for an
advanced undergraduate course in metallurgy/materials engineering, students coming from mechanical, civil or aerospace
engineering backgrounds will also be able to use this text as a course/reference book. In addition to students, practising
engineers and production mangers will also find this book very useful; particular with regard to designing components and
machine elements so as to resist fracture and failure in critical applications.
The present volume comprises a collection of peer-reviewed papers covering manufacture and production, engineering
materials, CAD/CAM/CAE, robotics, automation and control, environment-friendly design and manufacture, web/internet
technologies, artificial intelligence and smart computing in design and manufacture, enterprise, management, and other related
topics.Composite materials are increasingly finding use in diverse applications requiring a wide range of property and performance
requirements. Low density, high specific strength and stiffness are the main features that make composite materials most
suitable for structural applications. The field covers the concurrent manipulation of the material’s composition and of the
internal architecture of the composite in order to obtain the desired properties. The ability to tailor composite materials
precisely is of great importance in structural applications. A systematic approach to the optimum tailoring of composite
materials is a challenging design problem. The focus should be on the practical design aspects, and that is what is addressed in
this special-topic volume.The electronic properties of solids have become of increasing importance in the age of information technology. The study of

technologies, artificial intelligence and smart computing in design and manufacture, enterprise, management, and other related
topics.This work comprises eight contributions from leading experts on the topic of the mechanical behaviour of materials. The
research themes described in this special volume range from surface forces, surface energies and adhesion to the indentation
and nano-indentation of solids and fracture waves in glasses to spectroscopic studies of biological cells.The field of “polymers in concrete” is rather well consolidated within the construction industry, and its future will be one of
benefiting fully from the synergy between the organic and mineral materials. Concrete-polymer composites (C-PC) exhibit
excellent adhesion strength and durability in aggressive environments and the good performance of these materials makes
innovative applications possible; including new technologies for restoring and renovating buildings.
The purpose of this book is to present the current state of knowledge in the field of energy harvesting using piezoelectric and
pyroelectric materials. The book is addressed to students and academics engaged in research in the fields of energy harvesting,
material sciences and engineering. Scientists and engineers who are working in the area of energy conservation and renewable
energy resources should find it useful as well. Explanations of fundamental physical properties such as piezoelectricity and
pyroelectricity are included to aid the understanding of the non-specialist. Specific technologies and particular applications are
also presented. This book is divided into two parts, each subdivided into chapters. Part I concerns fundamentals. Chapter 1
reports the discoveries, standard issues and various materials involved with energy harvesting. Chapter 2 presents
electromechanical models enabling an understanding of how energy harvesting systems behave. The vibration theory and
designs for various piezoelectric energy harvesting structures are addressed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes the analytical
expressions for the energy flow in piezoelectric energy harvesting systems, in particular, with cymbal and flexible transducers. A
description of the conversion enhancement for powering low-energy consumption devices is presented in Chapter 5. Part II
concerns Applications and Case Studies. It begins with Chapter 6, in which the principles and applications of piezoelectric
nanogenerators are reported. Chapter 7 describes the utilization of energy harvesting from low-frequency energy sources. There
are more ways to use vibrational energy than waste heat. However, Chapter 8 presents the fundamentals of an important
application of heat conversion with a copolymer. Finally, commercial energy harvesting products and a technological forecast
are provided in Chapter 9.A major goal of this special collection of 47 peer-reviewed papers was to gather together the current knowledge of academic
scientists, engineers and industrial researchers and have them share their experiences and research results concerning every
aspect of green building technologies and materials, and discuss the practical challenges encountered and the solutions adopted.
An interesting guide to this increasingly relevant subject.The goal of this special collection of peer-reviewed papers was to provide an unique opportunity to exchange information, to
