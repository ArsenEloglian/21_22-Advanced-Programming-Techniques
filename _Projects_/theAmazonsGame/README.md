# TheAmazonsGame

Technologies used in the project:
- Android SDK
- Firebase

The application has been divided into 4 activities:
- MainActivity - the activity in which we log into the application
- MenuActivity - activity containing the application menu
- FindGameActivity - activity in which we enter the code of the game we want to join
- GameActivity - the activity on which the game takes place

When we create a new game, a code is generated that the other player must enter in the FindGameActivity activity.

To run application :

- open project in android studio
- configure environment (download and install jdk)
- create android emulator in Tools - Tools -> AVD manager (pixel 3a + API 30 + Android 11.0 + CPU x86)
- select your emulator from the list at the top
- run application (shift + F10)
- have fun :)
