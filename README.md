# TheAmazonsGame

Technologies used in the project:
- Android SDK
- Firebase

The application has been divided into 4 activities:
- MainActivity - the activity in which we log into the application
- MenuActivity - activity containing the application menu
- FindGameActivity - activity in which we enter the code of the game we want to join
- GameActivity - the activity on which the game takes place

When we create a new game, a code is generated that the other player must enter in the FindGameActivity activity.
